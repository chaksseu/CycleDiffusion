# CycleDiffusion

**CycleDiffusion** is a novel *cycle-consistent diffusion model* designed for **non-parallel, many-to-many voice conversion (VC)**. By simultaneously learning both **reconstruction and conversion paths**, CycleDiffusion outperforms conventional VAE- and GAN-based VC models in **speaker similarity**, **linguistic preservation**, and **speech naturalness**.

Voice conversion modifies a source speaker's voice to sound like that of a target speaker while preserving linguistic content. Diffusion Models (DMs) are promising due to their training stability and high-quality output. However, traditional DMs primarily learn reconstruction paths, limiting conversion quality. CycleDiffusion addresses this by:

- Learning both **reconstruction and conversion paths**
- Enforcing **cycle consistency loss** to preserve linguistic content
- Operating without **parallel training data**

## 🧠 Architecture

The architecture consists of **two diffusion models**:
- One for **voice conversion** from source to target
- One for **cycle reconstruction** back to the original

## 🚩 Highlights

- 🌀 **Cycle-Consistent Diffusion Architecture**  
  Two score-based diffusion models jointly trained to reconstruct and convert speech.

- 🔁 **Cycle Consistency Loss**  
  Minimizes the difference between the original and cyclically reconstructed speech, ensuring linguistic preservation.

- 🔗 **Non-parallel Training**  
  No need for aligned utterances across speakers.

- 📊 **Robust Performance**  
  Outperforms baseline DiffVC in cosine similarity, ASR accuracy, Mel-Cepstral Distance (MCD), and MOS.
