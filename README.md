# CycleDiffusion

**CycleDiffusion** is a novel voice conversion (VC) framework that leverages *cycle-consistent diffusion models* to enhance the quality and consistency of converted speech. By learning both reconstruction and conversion paths using diffusion architectures, our model achieves superior performance for non-parallel, many-to-many voice conversion tasks.

### Main Contributions:
- Proposing a novel **Cycle-Consistent Diffusion Model** for voice conversion.
- Introducing **Cycle Consistency Loss** to enhance semantic preservation across conversions.

---

## üö© Highlights

- **Cycle-Consistent Diffusion Architecture**  
  Two diffusion models jointly trained for reconstruction and voice conversion.
  
- **Cycle Consistency Loss**  
  Ensures preservation of linguistic content through cyclic conversions.

- **Non-parallel Training**  
  Eliminates the need for paired training samples.

- **Comprehensive Evaluations**  
  Speaker similarity, ASR-based linguistic preservation, Mel-Cepstral Distance (MCD), and subjective Mean Opinion Score (MOS).
